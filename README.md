## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **automatic light control system** using Arduino.
The system automatically turns ON the light when **motion is detected** in low-light conditions
and turns it OFF when no motion is detected or sufficient light is available.

## 🧠 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Relay Module
- Bulb / Load
- Resistors & Jumper Wires

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- LDR detects ambient light level  
- PIR sensor detects human motion  
- If motion is detected AND light level is low → Light turns ON  
- If no motion OR light level is sufficient → Light turns OFF
